# 2016YoutubeTVplus
an improved version of 2016youtubeTV by erievs (Erie Valley Software)


To use this, you must first install Node.js and NPM with node.js, and you also NEED to install Node, it is on macports if you are on macos, you also might need to install GIT if you aren't downloading directly from Github.

Now, unzip the node_modules.zip in the directory you have the other files in.

now that you have all thoughs downloaded and done, go to either terminal (Linux/MacOS) or CMD (Windows) and cd into the directory that you have the folder with all the files in it.

the command should be like this

cd /users/YOURNAME/Downloads/2016YoutubeTVplus-main/

then press enter (replace your name with your profiles name, if you are on mac, in terminal type cd then drag the folder to the command line and it should output the same result.

now do node 2016youtubetv_setup.js

enter your IP address you want to use (or do localhost.) if you are using 192.168.xxx.xxx and are going to post an issue, that IP tied to your local home network (only able to be seen by your router and other devices on that network.) and cannot be used to hack you unless the device used to hack you is also on that network. so do not censor it.

Finally, after setting it up emter npm start in the command line and to use it fo to the IP you put in and put :8090 after it, it should look like this, http://YOURIP:8090/ or http://localhost:8090/
